WebCrawler
==========

A simple web crawler meant for learning.
Initially it will crawl through a given 
number of links, given a seed URL. Later
I plan to implement multithreading to enhance it.

Even further, we might analyze the collected data
to generate some fruitful findings.

[The implementations are in Java.]
